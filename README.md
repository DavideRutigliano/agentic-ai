# How to Build an Agent - Workshop

A hands-on workshop for learning how to build AI agents with progressively increasing capabilities. This repository contains five different agent implementations that demonstrate the evolution from a simple chat interface to a fully capable agent with file system access and tool execution.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By working through this workshop, you will learn:

- How to integrate with the Gemini Gemini API
- The fundamentals of tool-calling and function execution
- How to build a robust agent event loop
- Progressive enhancement of agent capabilities
- Error handling and logging in agent systems
- Schema generation for tool parameters

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

All applications share a common architecture pattern with a central event loop that handles user input, sends messages to Gemini, processes tool calls, and returns results.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Agent Architecture"
        A[Agent] --> B[Gemini Client]
        A --> C[Tool Registry]
        A --> D[getUserMessage Function]
        A --> E[Verbose Logging]
    end
    
    subgraph "Shared Event Loop"
        F[Start Chat Session] --> G[Get User Input]
        G --> H{Empty Input?}
        H -->|Yes| G
        H -->|No| I[Add to Conversation]
        I --> J[runInference]
        J --> K[Gemini Response]
        K --> L{Tool Use?}
        L -->|No| M[Display Text]
        L -->|Yes| N[Execute Tools]
        N --> O[Collect Results]
        O --> P[Send Results to Gemini]
        P --> J
        M --> G
    end
    
    subgraph "Tool Execution Loop"
        N --> Q[Find Tool by Name]
        Q --> R[Execute Tool Function]
        R --> S[Capture Result/Error]
        S --> T[Add to Tool Results]
        T --> U{More Tools?}
        U -->|Yes| Q
        U -->|No| O
    end
```

## üìö Application Progression

The workshop is structured as a progression through five applications, each building upon the previous one's capabilities:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Application Progression"
        A[chat.go<br/>Basic Chat] --> B[read.go<br/>+ File Reading]
        B --> C[list_files.go<br/>+ Directory Listing]
        C --> D[bash_tool.go<br/>+ Shell Commands]
        D --> E[edit_tool.go<br/>+ File Editing]
    end
    
    subgraph "Tool Capabilities"
        F[No Tools] --> G[read_file]
        G --> H[read_file<br/>list_files]
        H --> I[read_file<br/>list_files<br/>bash]
        I --> J[read_file<br/>list_files<br/>bash<br/>edit_file]

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool System Architecture

The tool system uses a consistent pattern across all applications:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Agent {
        +client: *genai.Client
        +getUserMessage: func() (string, bool)
        +tools: []ToolDefinition
        +verbose: bool
        +Run(ctx Context) error
        +runInference(ctx Context, conversation []MessageParam) (*Message, error)
    }
    
    class ToolDefinition {
        +Name: string
        +Description: string
        +InputSchema: ToolInputSchemaParam
        +Function: func(input json.RawMessage) (string, error)
    }
    
    class ReadFileInput {
        +Path: string
    }
    
    class ListFilesInput {
        +Path: string
    }
    
    class BashInput {
        +Command: string
    }
    
    class EditFileInput {
        +Path: string
        +OldStr: string
        +NewStr: string
    }
    
    Agent --> ToolDefinition : uses
    ToolDefinition --> ReadFileInput : read_file
    ToolDefinition --> ListFilesInput : list_files  
    ToolDefinition --> BashInput : bash
    ToolDefinition --> EditFileInput : edit_file
```

## üöÄ Setup

### Prerequisites
- [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) (recommended) or Go 1.24.2+
- Gemini API key

### Environment Setup

1. **Using devenv (recommended)**:
```bash
devenv shell  # Enters development environment with all dependencies
```

2. **Manual setup**:
```bash
# Ensure Go 1.24.2+ is installed
go mod tidy
```

### API Key Configuration
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Chat
```bash
$ go run chat.go
Chat with Gemini (use 'ctrl-c' to quit)
You: Hello!
Gemini: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

### File Operations
```bash
$ go run edit_tool.go
Chat with Gemini (use 'ctrl-c' to quit)
You: What files are in this directory?
tool: list_files({})
result: [".devenv.flake.nix",".gitignore","AGENT.md","bash_tool.go"...]
Gemini: I can see several files in this directory, including Go source files for different agent implementations...

You: Read the riddle.txt file
tool: read_file({"path":"riddle.txt"})
result: I have a mane but I'm not a lion...
Gemini: This is a riddle! The answer is "a horse"...
```

### Debugging with Verbose Mode
```bash
$ go run edit_tool.go --verbose
# Provides detailed logging of:
# - API calls and timing
# - Tool execution details
# - File operations
# - Error traces
```

## üß™ Test Files

The repository includes sample files for testing:

- **`fizzbuzz.js`**: A JavaScript FizzBuzz implementation for reading/editing
- **`riddle.txt`**: A simple riddle for content analysis
- **`AGENT.md`**: Development environment documentation

## üîß Development Environment

This project uses [devenv](https://devenv.sh/) for reproducible development environments with:

- Go toolchain
- Node.js and TypeScript
- Python environment
- Rust toolchain
- .NET Core
- Git and common development tools

The environment automatically sets up all dependencies and provides helpful scripts:

```bash
devenv shell    # Enter development environment
devenv test     # Run environment tests
hello          # Custom greeting script
```

## üîç Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Event Loop Pattern
All agents use the same core event loop that:
1. Accepts user input
2. Maintains conversation history
3. Calls Gemini API with tools
4. Processes tool use requests
5. Executes tools and collects results
6. Returns results to Gemini for final response

### Tool Definition Pattern
```go
var ToolDefinition = ToolDefinition{
    Name:        "tool_name",
    Description: "What the tool does",
    InputSchema: GenerateSchema[InputStruct](),
    Function:    ToolFunction,
}
```

### Schema Generation
Automatic JSON schema generation from Go structs using reflection and jsonschema tags.

### Error Handling
Consistent error handling across all tools with proper logging and user feedback.

### Progressive Enhancement
Each application builds upon the previous one, demonstrating how to gradually add capabilities to an agent system.

## üö¶ Common Issues and Solutions

### API Key Issues
- Ensure `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- Check that your API key has sufficient credits

### Tool Execution Errors
- Use `--verbose` flag to see detailed error logs
- Check file permissions for file operations
- Verify paths are relative to the working directory

### Environment Issues
- Use `devenv shell` for consistent environment
- Run `go mod tidy` if dependencies are missing
- Check Go version compatibility (1.24.2+)

## üéØ Next Steps

After completing this workshop, consider exploring:

- Adding more specialized tools (web scraping, API calls, etc.)
- Implementing tool chaining and workflows
- Adding persistent memory and state management
- Building web interfaces for your agents
- Integrating with other AI models and services
